# Answer

We’ll use the
[lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html)
package.

Here’s the appropriate section in
[R4DS](https://bookdown.org/roy_schumacher/r4ds/dates-and-times.html)

I like to load the tidyverse master library in the beginning using
`library(tidyverse)`.

The tidyverse library includes many packages often used, including
libraries for lubridate and dplyr.

## Before we get started: `glimpse()` function

The `glimpse()` function allows us to search any object in R. It is in
the dplyr package, an important library in the “Tidyverse”.

I sometimes include the package name before a function for learning
purposes to emphasize which library the function comes from.

For example, I could write `dplyr:glimpse()`

But from here forward I’ll use `glimpse()`

## Simulating the starting data

We’ll create a vector of dates formatted as they were in the initial
question: `11/4/2021  7:00:00 AM`

I arbitrarily chose to make a vector of 20 dates for this example.

Don’t worry about how we’re doing this for now; it’s not important for
learning how to answer our question.

    ##  chr [1:20] "03/05/96 06:25:08 PM" "04/10/96 01:39:29 PM" ...

## Whats the class?

If we look at our vector, we can see which “class” it has using the
`class()` function.

``` r
# show the current class before parsing
sample_dates %>% class()
```

    ## [1] "character"

A character class is commonly used in R. It is basically text. It is
sometimes called a “string” in other programming languages. But in R we
call in “character”

## POSIXct: the class of date and time

Dates are handled best in R using the “POSIXct” class, which is
basically an integer with a starting point (e.g., the birth of Christ in
year 0, or some other reference point I cannot recall).

Let’s use the lubridate package, specifically the `parse_date_time()`
function which will convert our “character” class to the “POSIXct”
class.

``` r
# convert character format into date format (POSIXct)
sample_dates_posixct <- sample_dates %>% lubridate::parse_date_time("%m/%d/%y %I:%M:%S %p")
sample_dates_posixct %>% glimpse
```

    ##  POSIXct[1:20], format: "1996-03-05 18:25:08" "1996-04-10 13:39:29" "1997-11-18 04:11:14" ...

After taking a glimpse at our new vector, we see the old character
vector is now in the standard “POSIXct” format, which is easy to work
with.

Let’s check the class specifically again using the `class()` function.

``` r
# show the new class after parsing
sample_dates_posixct %>% class()
```

    ## [1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt"

But how did we tell the `parse_date_time()` function to interpret the
character dates correctly into the POSIXct class?

### Formatting date and time in R

We had to supply the formats of our character vector to the function
`lubridate:parse_date_time()`

We told the lubridate function our old character vector was in the
following format: `%m/%d/%y %I:%M:%S %p`

All date and time formats can be illustrated in R by searching the
documentation of the `strptime()` function.

From the documentation, we can see what each piece of the above line
means:

`%m` is for “Month as decimal number (01–12)”

`%d` is for “Day of the month as decimal number (01–31)”

See if you can search the documentation for `strptime()` to see what the
other codes mean.

### Searching the documentation

Call the documentation for any function by typing a question mark before
it, without parenthesis: `?strptime()`

This works for any function. Try it out with some of the other functions
we’ve used above:

`?class()`

`?glimpse()`

Reading the documentation is an essential R skill. I use it often to
determine how to use a specific function.

## Outputting the date as month and year

So our original goal was to convert these dates to just the month and
year.

We can use the lubridate package to create separate vectors of just the
month and year.

This is done simply using the `lubridate:month()` and `lubridate:year()`
functions.

``` r
sample_dates_months <- sample_dates_posixct %>% lubridate::month()
sample_dates_months %>% glimpse
```

    ##  num [1:20] 3 4 11 11 1 3 6 9 10 10 ...

``` r
sample_dates_years <- sample_dates_posixct %>% lubridate::year()
sample_dates_years %>% glimpse
```

    ##  num [1:20] 1996 1996 1997 2001 2003 ...

But we wanted a variable that was month and year

``` r
sample_dates_mos_year <- paste0(sample_dates_months, sep = "/", sample_dates_years)
sample_dates_mos_year %>% glimpse
```

    ##  chr [1:20] "3/1996" "4/1996" "11/1997" "11/2001" "1/2003" "3/2004" ...

Check out the documentation for the function `paste0()`

See if you can figure out how it works.

## Tibble: putting it all together

Now that we have all these vectors, lets wrap them all up into a tibble,
a commonly used object in R. A tibble used to be a data frame, but this
is the upgraded version.

``` r
tibble::tibble(
  "question" = sample_dates,
  "answer" = sample_dates_mos_year
)
```

    ## # A tibble: 20 × 2
    ##    question             answer 
    ##    <chr>                <chr>  
    ##  1 03/05/96 06:25:08 PM 3/1996 
    ##  2 04/10/96 01:39:29 PM 4/1996 
    ##  3 11/18/97 04:11:14 AM 11/1997
    ##  4 11/21/01 03:50:10 AM 11/2001
    ##  5 01/19/03 10:25:31 AM 1/2003 
    ##  6 03/06/04 11:36:52 PM 3/2004 
    ##  7 06/13/06 09:45:07 PM 6/2006 
    ##  8 09/10/07 12:04:55 PM 9/2007 
    ##  9 10/14/07 01:12:53 AM 10/2007
    ## 10 10/14/09 02:45:40 AM 10/2009
    ## 11 06/09/10 04:23:13 PM 6/2010 
    ## 12 01/12/11 09:58:48 AM 1/2011 
    ## 13 12/20/13 12:05:44 PM 12/2013
    ## 14 01/25/17 08:59:58 PM 1/2017 
    ## 15 09/21/19 10:39:48 AM 9/2019 
    ## 16 12/26/19 01:03:05 PM 12/2019
    ## 17 03/11/20 07:38:36 AM 3/2020 
    ## 18 04/30/21 10:14:34 PM 4/2021 
    ## 19 09/21/21 11:06:12 AM 9/2021 
    ## 20 10/15/21 06:52:01 AM 10/2021
